
## Deployment

To deploy this project run

clone the project in your device

open the project folder and open terminal/cmd inside the directory
i.e. react-curd-application/

```bash
cd client
```
the path will be react-curd-application/client

```bash
npm i
```
then to start the client 
```bash
npm start
```

### To connect the client to server

then again go back to project folder and follow the steps again
i.e. react-curd-application/

```bash
npm i
```

then we need to start the server to connect client to MongoDB server

```bash
cd server
```

the path will look like this

i.e. react-curd-application/server

run this command to start the connection

```bash
node app.js
```

## now that the both client and server is running it should look like following screenshoot.
